        <p>As she celebrated her victory, many people took notice of her, including someone who would help guide her to the next step in her pageantry dreams. Enter Cherise Loupos, who saw immense potential in Poppie and encouraged her to enter the <strong>Infinity Pageants Miss Krugersdorp</strong> competition. At first, Poppie was hesitant. She was juggling a tight schedule with her matric year and responsibilities as a Young Adults representative in her church community. However, after much consideration, trust in Heavenly Father, and support from her family and friends, Poppie took the leap and entered the pageant. Thus began her year-long journey.</p>

        <p>Poppie’s campaign journey was nothing short of an adventure. It was filled with unforgettable moments and, of course, its share of challenges. But through it all, she persevered, remaining the strong and amazing young woman we know her to be. Throughout the campaign, Poppie, along with her mentor, took part in several charitable events, serving her beloved community. Everywhere she went, people couldn’t help but rave about her beautiful personality and her ability to brighten everyone’s day.</p>

        <p>Two particular charity events stood out during Poppie’s campaign. The first was the <strong>Lions Annual Warrior Race for Westrand School Students</strong>. Here’s what she had to say about the event:</p>

            <p>"Had an absolute blast at the Lions Annual Warrior Race for Westrand School students! 🦁💖 Witnessing their joy and eagerness to start the race was nothing short of heartwarming! Their smiles were radiant, and their excitement infectious! It was so much fun connecting with the kids, sharing laughs, and telling jokes!

Here’s to the spirit of camaraderie and unforgettable moments! 🏅✨ A big shoutout to everyone who participated and made this event a success! Let’s do it again next year! ❤💪"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The second event was the <strong>Infinity Group Golf Day</strong>, which aimed to raise funds for a little girl battling leukemia. The event was a heartwarming success and touched Poppie deeply. These charitable experiences inspired her to step up and become the leader her community could be proud of.</p>

        <p>During the campaign, Poppie also had the opportunity to judge a pageant, <strong>Mr. and Miss Millies</strong>. Here's what she shared about the experience:</p>

        <blockquote>

It’s been almost a year since I started this journey, and I am incredibly grateful to each and every one of you! I have formed bonds and friendships with incredible people, and I will forever be thankful for that. Being crowned <strong>Miss Westrand</strong>, <strong>Miss Krugersdorp</strong>, and <strong>Miss Krugersdorp Charity</strong> is an absolute honor! ❤ Thank you to my parents for being such an amazing support structure and to my friends for encouraging me to be my true self. This is only the beginning! 💖🙏"</p>
